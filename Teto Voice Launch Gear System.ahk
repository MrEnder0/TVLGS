Developer: MrEnder
Commissioner: Heliodor
Made in: February 2023
Version: 1.4

    How to use: When application is started make sure to select your keybind for your landing gear that you have aLso set in game. When that is selected make sure to click start.
    
    How to close: The best way to close is to press {input key} + esc + ctrl, make sure you have waited your min delay before trying to do this keybind, this will force close the app, another way to close the app is to go to your icon tray on the bottom right of your screen your icon tray should be an up arrow. On that tray you can find the app to close it right click and select "Exit".
    
    How to configure: To configure the settings for the app click "Options" the gui should expand and reveal many options that can be changed. To confirm your settings click "Minimize" and the window should restore to normal and keep your settings for the rest of the session. If you want to save your settings and have them stay inbetween sessions edit the file named "settings.ini" this file will be in the same directory as your executable.

    How to swap the sounds for the voicelines: To swap the sounds for the voice lines make sure to open up the folder that this executable in stored in you should see a subfolder named "sounds" inside of that folder you can remove the old ones and put the new ones in. Make sure they have the exact same name this includes the file extension if you dont it wont detect the sound and it wont work.

    How to show gui: A way you can show the app gui without restarting is pretty simple, just press {input key} + esc + alt, make sure you have waited your min delay before trying to do this keybind, this will force close the app, then just start the app again and it should show the gui. Also keep in mind the voiceline wont flip it will replay the same voiceline after pressing the key again.
    
    Voiceline desync issue: Make sure you are not pressing your landing gear key while not being in the ship or it will false detect it and desync the voice lines with what is actually happening. If the issue is still happening make sure when you start the app that your ship is landed with all systems off and that your landing gear is down.

    How to change the background color: To change the background color of the app you can edit the file named "settings.ini" this file will be in the same directory as your executable. You can change the hex code for the background color to any color you want. Make sure to not put 0x in front of the hex code.

    How to change the banner: To change the banner you can edit the file named "settings.ini" this file will be in the same directory as your executable. You can change the path to the banner to any path you want. Just make sure the name of the file is exactly "TetoBanner.png".

    How to restore the settings: To restore the settings to default you can click "Restore Settings" in the options gui all the way at the bottom. If you do not see this make sure you have opened the options gui by clicking "Options" in the main gui.
